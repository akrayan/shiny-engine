[ ] SceneLoader

*To fix
- what if the layer of a sprite change ?

*To think
- put a requirement / dependency in scene.json and in every Json ?
- dinamic load ? (address evry ressource with an Id if not in the cache load it dinamically ? in that case how to set those properties ? two properties one public is a string, take a path and the other an Object ? polymoriphisme to allow to give an object ?)
